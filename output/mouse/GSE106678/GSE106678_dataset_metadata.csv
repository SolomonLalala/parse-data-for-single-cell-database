GSE106678,Dissecting cell-type composition and activity-dependent transcriptional state in mammalian brains by massively parallel single-nucleus RNA-Seq,"Massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing can precisely resolve cellular diversity in a high-throughput manner at low cost, but unbiased isolation of intact single cells from complex tissues, such as adult mammalian brains, is challenging. Here, we integrate sucrose-gradient assisted nuclei purification with droplet microfluidics to develop a highly scalable single-nucleus RNA-Seq approach (sNucDrop-Seq), which is free of enzymatic dissociation and nuclei sorting. By profiling ~18,000 nuclei isolated from cortical tissues of adult mice, we demonstrate that sNucDrop-Seq not only accurately reveals neuronal and non-neuronal subtype composition with high sensitivity, but also enables in-depth analysis of transient transcriptional states driven by neuronal activity, at single-cell resolution, in vivo.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE106678,29220646,Single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis of adult mouse cerebral cortex,GSM2845359 GSM2845360 GSM2845361 GSM2845362 GSM2845363 GSM2845364 GSM2845365 GSM2845366 GSM2845367 GSM2845368 GSM2845369 GSM2845370 GSM2845371 GSM2845372 GSM2845373 GSM2845374 GSM2845375 GSM2845376 GSM2845377 ,Public on Dec 07 2017,"Massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing can precisely resolve cellular diversity in a high-throughput manner at low cost, but unbiased isolation of intact single cells from complex tissues, such as adult mammalian brains, is challenging.
