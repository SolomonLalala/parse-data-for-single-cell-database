GSE118948,Single-cell profiling of the myeloid landscape identifies cell subsets with distinct fates during neuroinflammation,"The innate immune cell compartment is highly diverse in the healthy central nervous system (CNS) including parenchymal and non-parenchymal macrophages. However, this complexity is increased in inflammatory settings by the recruitment of circulating myeloid cells. It is unclear which disease-specific myeloid subsets exist and what their transcriptional profiles and dynamics during CNS pathology are. By combining deep single-cell transcriptome analysis, fate mapping, in vivo imaging, clonal analysis, and transgenic lines, we comprehensively characterized unappreciated myeloid subsets in several CNS compartments during neuroinflammation. During inflammation, CNS macrophage subsets undergo self-renewal, and random proliferation shifted towards clonal expansion. Finally, functional studies demonstrated that endogenous CNS tissue macrophages are redundant for antigen presentation. Our results highlight myeloid cell diversity and provide insights into the brain<e2><80><99>s innate immune system.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE118948,30679343,"CD45+ cells isolated from different CNS compartments (including leptomeninges, perivascular space and parenchyma, and choroid plexus) and Ly6Chigh and Ly6Clow monocytes from blood were FACS-sorted in 384-well plates and used for scRNAseq. All myeloid cells were sorted from C57BL/6N mice with 8-10 weeks of age at naive stage or at different stages of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (preclinical, onset and peak of the disease). Data are representative of 16-18 mice from three independent experiments. mCEL-Seq2 protocol was used for single cell sequencing (Hashimshony et al. 2016, Herman et al. 2018).",GSM3351706 GSM3351707 GSM3351708 GSM3351709 GSM3351710 GSM3351711 GSM3351712 GSM3351713 GSM3351714 GSM3351715 GSM3351716 GSM3351717 GSM3351718 GSM3351719 GSM3351720 GSM3351721 GSM3351722 GSM3351723 GSM3351724 GSM3351725 GSM3351726 GSM3351727 GSM3351728 GSM3351729 GSM3351730 GSM3351731 GSM3351732 GSM3351733 GSM3351734 GSM3351735 GSM3351736 GSM3351737 GSM3351738 GSM3351739 GSM3351740 GSM3351741 GSM3351742 GSM3351743 GSM3351744 GSM3351745 GSM3351746 GSM3351747 GSM3351748 GSM3351749 GSM3351750 GSM3351751 GSM3351752 GSM3351753 GSM3351754 GSM3351755 GSM3351756 GSM3351757 GSM3351758 GSM3351759 GSM3351760 ,Public on Jan 25 2019,"The innate immune cell compartment is highly diverse in the healthy central nervous system (CNS) including parenchymal and non-parenchymal macrophages.
