GSE111527,Single-cell transcriptomics characterizes cell types in the subventricular zone and uncovers molecular defects impairing adult neurogenesis.,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) contribute to plasticity and repair of the adult brain. Niches harboring NSCs regulate stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. We used comprehensive and untargeted single-cell RNA profiling to generate a molecular cell atlas of the largest germinal region of the adult mouse brain, the subventricular zone (SVZ). We characterized > 20 neural and non-neural cell types and gained insights into the dynamics of neurogenesis by predicting future cell states based on computational analysis of RNA kinetics. Furthermore, we applied our single-cell approach to document decreased numbers of NSCs, reduced proliferation activity of progenitors, and perturbations in Wnt and BMP signaling pathways in mice lacking LRP2, an endocytic receptor required for SVZ maintenance. Our data provide a valuable resource to study adult neurogenesis and a proof-of-principle for the power of single-cell RNA-sequencing to elucidate neural cell type-specific alterations in loss-of-function models.",https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(18)31732-7,30485812,We subjected cells derived from the adult subventricular zone neurogenic niche to single-cell RNA sequencing without pre-selection and sorting.,GSM3032675 GSM3032676 GSM3032677 GSM3032678 GSM3032679 GSM3032680 GSM3032681 GSM3032682 GSM3032683 ,Public on Nov 26 2018,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) contribute to plasticity and repair of the adult brain.
