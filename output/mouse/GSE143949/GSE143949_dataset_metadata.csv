Four cell captures and sequencing runs were conducted with four to eight fetal brains used for each collection. For each brain, the cerebral cortex was dissected and collected (although ventral forebrain structures, especially the gonglionic eminence may be mixed in due to difficulty in dissection).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE143949,,Single cell RNA-seq analysis of embryonic mouse cerebral cortex at E15.5,GSM4277166 GSM4277167 GSM4277168 GSM4277169 GSM4277170 GSM4277171 GSM4277172 GSM4277173 GSM4277174 GSM4277175 GSM4277176 GSM4277177 GSM4277178 GSM4277179 GSM4277180 GSM4277181 ,Public on Jul 01 2020,"Single cell RNA-seq was conducted on embryonic brains from wild-type CD1 mice at embryonic day 15.5 following The Illumina<c2><ae> Bio-Rad<c2><ae> SureCell Single-Cell RNA Sequencing workflow.
