GSE118068,Childhood Cerebellar Tumors Mirror Conserved Fetal Transcriptional Programs,"The study of the origin and development of cerebellar tumours has been hampered by the complexity and heterogeneity of cerebellar cells that change over the course of development. We used single-cell transcriptomics to study >60,000 cells from the developing murine cerebellum, and show that different molecular subgroups of childhood cerebellar tumours mirror the transcription of cells from distinct, temporally restricted cerebellar lineages. Sonic Hedgehog medulloblastoma transcriptionally mirrors the granule cell hierarchy as expected, whereas Grp3-MB resemble Nestin+ve stem cells, Group 4 medulloblastomas resemble unipolar brush cells, and PFA/PFB ependymoma and cerebellar pilocytic astrocytoma resemble the pre-natal gliogenic progenitor cells. Furthermore, single-cell transcriptomics of human childhood cerebellar tumours demonstrates that many bulk tumours contain a mixed population of cells with divergent differentiation. Our data highlight cerebellar tumours as a disorder of early brain development, and provide a proximate explanation for the peak incidence of cerebellar tumours in early childhood.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE118068,31043743,9 mouse hindbrains from different developmental stages were processed for single cell mRNA sequencing.
