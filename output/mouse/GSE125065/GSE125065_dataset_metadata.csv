GSE125065,Single cell transcriptomic analysis of the lateral hypothalamic area reveals molecularly distinct populations of inhibitory and excitatory neurons,"We employed a droplet-based single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) approach to develop a comprehensive census of molecularly distinct cell types in the mouse lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). In addition to 13 distinct non-neuronal cell populations, we define 15 distinct populations of glutamatergic and 15 distinct populations of GABAergic neurons, including both known and novel cell types. This comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of LHA cell types lays the groundwork for understanding the circuit-level underpinnings of LHA coordination of innate behavior.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE125065,30858605,"Two single cell transcriptomic (Chromium v2 chemistry) data sets of P30-aged mouse LHA, one of 3 pooled male and the other of 2 pooled female animals.",GSM3562050 GSM3562051 ,Public on Jan 15 2019,"We employed a droplet-based single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) approach to develop a comprehensive census of molecularly distinct cell types in the mouse lateral hypothalamic area (LHA).
