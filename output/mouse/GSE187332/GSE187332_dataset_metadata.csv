GSE187332,Decay of heterochromatin domains at selective gene loci in aging mouse brain cells,"Aging is characterized by a progressive decline of organismal function and increase in vulnerability to diseases. Loss of heterochromatin during aging has been observed in a variety of organisms, however, understanding its role in aging-related phenotypes has been limited by the lack of information about the specific cell types and gene loci affected by this type of epigenetic changes. To address this bottleneck, we probed dynamic changes in chromatin landscape at single cell resolution in the forebrain, hippocampus, heart, skeletal muscle and bone marrows from 3-month, 10-month and 18-month-old mice, and characterized age-associated changes in chromatin accessibility at over 300,000 candidate regulatory elements across 34 major cell types. We report that excitatory neurons displayed profound changes in a specific set of heterochromatin domains during aging, evidenced by an increase in chromatin accessibility, a decrease in the heterochromatin marker H3K9me3, and de-repression of non-coding RNA species. These results suggest that heterochromatin maintenance are impaired in aging excitatory neurons, and this may be associated with increased repetitive element activity and neurodegenerative diseases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE187332,36207411,"We collected the dorsal hippocampus, frontal cortex, heart, leg muscles and bone marrow from male C57BL/6JN mice in three age groups, namely 3-month, 10-month, and 18-month, and performed single-nucleus ATAC-seq to profile  open chormatin changes during aging. We also performed single-nucleus RNA-seq and paired-tag for H3K9me3 on dorsal hippocampus and frontal cortex.",GSM5667881 GSM5667882 GSM5667883 GSM5667884 GSM5667885 GSM5667886 GSM5667887 GSM5667888 GSM5667889 GSM5667890 GSM5667891 GSM5667892 GSM5667893 GSM5667894 GSM5667895 GSM5667896 GSM5667897 GSM5667898 GSM5667899 GSM5667900 GSM5667901 GSM5667902 GSM5667903 GSM5667904 GSM5667905 GSM5667906 GSM5667907 GSM5667908 GSM5667909 GSM5667910 GSM5667911 GSM5667912 GSM5667913 GSM5667914 GSM5667915 GSM5667916 GSM5667917 GSM5667918 GSM5667919 GSM5667920 GSM5667921 GSM5667922 GSM5667923 GSM5667924 GSM5667925 GSM5667926 GSM5667927 GSM5667928 GSM5667929 GSM5667930 GSM5667931 GSM5667932 GSM5667933 GSM5667934 GSM5667935 GSM5667936 GSM5667937 GSM5667938 GSM5667939 ,Public on Sep 13 2022,"Aging is characterized by a progressive decline of organismal function and increase in vulnerability to diseases.
