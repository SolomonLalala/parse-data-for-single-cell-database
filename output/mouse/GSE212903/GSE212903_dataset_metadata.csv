GSE212903,Spatial transcriptomics of the mouse brain across three age groups,"Aging is a key driver of cognitive decline and the predominant risk factor for several neurodegenerative diseases. Recent behavioral studies as well as structural and functional MRI data suggest that aging does not impact the brain in a uniform manner but follows region- and age-specific trajectories. Yet so far, quantitative analyses of the molecular dynamics in the aging brain have been limited to few regions at low temporal resolution. Here we use the 10X Visium platform to perform spatial transcriptomics (Spatial-seq) of equivalent coronal sections  of the mouse brain at young (6 months), middle (18 months) and old (21 months) age.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE212903,,"Spatial RNA-seq of coronal brain sections from young, middle and old mice using 10x Genomics Visium for OCT embedded tissue (v3').",GSM6560897 GSM6560898 GSM6560899 GSM6560900 GSM6560901 GSM6560902 ,Public on Apr 17 2023,"Aging is a key driver of cognitive decline and the predominant risk factor for several neurodegenerative diseases.
