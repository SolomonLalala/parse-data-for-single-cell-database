GSE141044,Single-nucleus RNA sequencing reveals transcriptional changes of hippocampal neurons in APP23 mouse model of Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s disease,"Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that mostly strikes the elderly. However, the exact molecular and cellular pathogenesis of AD, especially the dynamic changes of neurons during disease progression, remains poorly understood. Here we used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to access the transcriptional changes of hippocampal neurons in APP23 mouse model of AD. We performed snRNA-seq using a modified Smart-seq2 technique on 3,280 neuronal nuclei from the hippocampus of young and aged APP23 and control mice and identified four distinct subpopulations. Comparative transcriptional analysis showed multiple changes in different subtypes of hippocampal neurons of APP23 mice in comparison to control mice, as well as the transcriptional changes in these neurons during disease progression. Our findings revealed multiple neuronal subtype-specific transcriptional changes that may lead to targets for future studies of AD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE141044,31928331,revealed multiple neuronal subtype-specific transcriptional changes in 6-month old WT(wild type) mouse and 24-month old APP23 mouse,GSM4194799 GSM4194800 GSM4194801 GSM4194802 GSM4194803 GSM4194804 GSM4194805 GSM4194806 GSM4194807 GSM4194808 GSM4194809 ,Public on Nov 27 2019,"Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that mostly strikes the elderly.
