GSE98969,Single cell RNA-seq identifies a unique microglia type associated with Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s disease [RNA],"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a detrimental neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatments. Due to cellular heterogeneity, the roles of immune cell subsets in AD onset and progression are poorly understood. By transcriptional single cell sorting, we comprehensively map all immune populations in wild type and AD<e2><80><93>transgenic (Tg-AD) mouse brains. We describe a novel microglia type associated with neurodegenerative diseases (DAM) and identify the markers, spatial-location, and pathways associated with these cells. Immunohistochemical staining of mice and human brain slices showed DAM with intracellular/phagocytic A<ce><b2> particles. Single cell analysis of DAM in Tg-AD and Trem2-/- Tg-AD revealed that the DAM program is activated in a two-step process. Activation is initiated in a Trem2 independent manner which involves down-regulation of microglia checkpoints, followed by activation of a Trem2-dependent program. These data identify a unique microglia-type, which may have important implications for future treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE98969,28602351,"Transcriptional profiling of single cells from immune populations of mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases with matched controls, generated from deep sequencing of tens of thousands of cells, sequenced in several batches on illumina Nextseq500",GSM2629341 GSM2629342 GSM2629343 GSM2629344 GSM2629345 GSM2629346 GSM2629347 GSM2629348 GSM2629352 GSM2629353 GSM2629354 GSM2629355 GSM2629356 GSM2629357 GSM2629358 GSM2629359 GSM2629360 GSM2629361 GSM2629362 GSM2629363 GSM2629364 GSM2629365 GSM2629366 GSM2629367 GSM2629368 GSM2629369 GSM2629370 GSM2629371 GSM2629372 GSM2629373 GSM2629374 GSM2629375 GSM2629376 GSM2629377 GSM2629387 GSM2629388 GSM2629389 GSM2629390 GSM2629391 GSM2629392 GSM2629393 GSM2629394 GSM2629395 GSM2629396 GSM2629397 GSM2629398 GSM2629399 GSM2629400 GSM2629401 GSM2629402 GSM2629403 GSM2629404 GSM2629405 GSM2629406 GSM2629407 GSM2629408 GSM2629409 GSM2629410 GSM2629411 GSM2629412 GSM2629413 GSM2629414 GSM2629415 GSM2629416 GSM2629417 GSM2629418 GSM2629419 GSM2629420 GSM2629421 GSM2629422 GSM2629423 GSM2629424 GSM2629425 GSM2629426 GSM2629427 GSM2629428 GSM2629429 GSM2629430 GSM2629431 GSM2629432 GSM2629433 GSM2629434 GSM2629435 GSM2629436 GSM2629437 GSM2629438 GSM2629439 GSM2629440 GSM2629441 GSM2629442 GSM2629443 GSM2629444 GSM2629445 GSM2629446 GSM2629447 GSM2629448 GSM2629449 ,Public on Jun 12 2017,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a detrimental neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatments.
