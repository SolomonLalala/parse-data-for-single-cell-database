GSE141856,Genome-wide in vivo CNS Screening Identifies Genes that Modify CNS Neuronal Survival and mHTT Toxicity,"Unbiased in vivo genome-wide genetic screening is a powerful approach to elucidate new molecular mechanisms, but such screening has not been possible to perform in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS).  Here we report the results of the first genome-wide genetic screens in the CNS using both shRNA and CRISPR libraries.  Our screens identify many classes of CNS neuronal essential genes, and demonstrate that CNS neurons are particularly sensitive not only to perturbations to synaptic processes, but also autophagy, proteostasis, mRNA processing, and mitochondrial function.  These results reveal a molecular logic for the common implication of these pathways across multiple neurodegenerative diseases.  To further identify disease-relevant genetic modifiers, we applied our screening approach to two mouse models of Huntington<e2><80><99>s disease (HD).  Top mutant Huntingtin toxicity modifier genes included several Nme genes and several genes involved in methylation-dependent chromatin silencing and dopamine signaling, results that reveal new HD therapeutic target pathways.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE141856,32004439,Single-cell profiling of Nme1 overexpressing spiny projection neurons in R62 mouse model of HD,GSM4214745 GSM4214746 GSM4214747 GSM4214748 GSM4214749 GSM4214750 GSM4214751 GSM4214752 GSM4214753 GSM4214754 GSM4214755 GSM4214756 GSM4214757 GSM4214758 GSM4214759 GSM4214760 GSM4214761 GSM4214762 GSM4214763 GSM4214764 ,Public on Jan 30 2020,"Unbiased in vivo genome-wide genetic screening is a powerful approach to elucidate new molecular mechanisms, but such screening has not been possible to perform in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS).
