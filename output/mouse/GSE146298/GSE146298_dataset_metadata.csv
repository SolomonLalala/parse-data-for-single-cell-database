GSE146298,Enhancing WNT-Signaling Restores Cortical Neuronal Spine Maturation and Synaptogenesis in Tbr1 Mutants,"Tbr1 is a high confidence autism spectrum disorder (ASD) gene encoding a
transcription factor with distinct pre- and postnatal functions.
Postnatally, Tbr1 conditional mutants (CKOs) and constitutive heterozygotes have
immature dendritic spines and reduced synaptic density. Tbr1 regulates expression of
several genes that underlie synaptic defects, including a kinesin (Kif1a) and a WNT
signaling ligand (Wnt7b). Furthermore, Tbr1 mutant corticothalamic neurons have
reduced thalamic axonal arborization. LiCl and a GSK3b-inhibitor, two WNT-signaling
agonists, robustly rescue the dendritic spines, synaptic and axonal defects, suggesting
that this could have relevance for therapeutic approaches in some forms of ASD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE146298,32294447,Examination of TBR1 regulated genes in layer 5 FACS purified neurons from P5 mouse medial prefrontal cortex.,GSM4376958 GSM4376959 GSM4376960 ,Public on Mar 04 2020,"Tbr1 is a high confidence autism spectrum disorder (ASD) gene encoding a
