GSE207848,Mapping the cellular and molecular organization of mouse cerebral aging by single-cell transcriptome imaging,"The enormous cellular diversity and complex tissue organization of the brain have hindered systematic characterization of its age-related changes in cellular and molecular architecture and mechanistic understanding of its functional decline and degeneration during aging. Here we generated a high-resolution cell atlas of brain aging within the frontal cortex and striatum using spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics and quantified the changes in gene expression and spatial organization of major cell types in these regions over the lifespan of mice. We observed more pronounced changes in the composition, gene expression and spatial organization of non-neuronal cells over neurons. Our data revealed molecular and spatial signatures of glial and immune cell activation during aging, particularly within the white matter of the corpus callosum, and identified both similarities and differences in cell activation patterns induced by aging and systemic inflammatory challenge. These results provide critical insights into age-related decline and inflammation in the brain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE207848,36580914,Nuclei of 2 young (4 week old) and 2 aged (90 week old) mice were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) according to the presence of Hoeschst signal and analyzed using 10X Genomics snRNA-seq.,GSM6321073 GSM6321074 GSM6321075 GSM6321076 GSM6321077 GSM6321078 GSM6321079 GSM6321080 ,Public on Jul 13 2022,"The enormous cellular diversity and complex tissue organization of the brain have hindered systematic characterization of its age-related changes in cellular and molecular architecture and mechanistic understanding of its functional decline and degeneration during aging.
