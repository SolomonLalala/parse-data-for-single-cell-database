GSE129788,Single-cell transcriptomic profiling of the aging mouse brain,"The mammalian brain is complex, with multiple cell types performing a variety of diverse functions, but exactly how each cell type is affected in aging remains largely unknown. Here we performed a single-cell transcriptomic analysis of young and old mouse brains. We provide comprehensive datasets of aging-related genes, pathways and ligand<e2><80><93>receptor interactions in nearly all brain cell types. Our analysis identified gene signatures that vary in a coordinated manner across cell types and gene sets that are regulated in a cell-type specific manner, even at times in opposite directions. These data reveal that aging, rather than inducing a universal program, drives a distinct transcriptional course in each cell population, and they highlight key molecular processes, including ribosome biogenesis, underlying brain aging. Overall, these large-scale datasets provide a resource for the neuroscience community that will facilitate additional discoveries directed towards understanding and modifying the aging process.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE129788,31551601,"Total of 16 mice brains with raw data for 50,212 single cells and processed data for 37,089 single cells",GSM3722100 GSM3722101 GSM3722102 GSM3722103 GSM3722104 GSM3722105 GSM3722106 GSM3722107 GSM3722108 GSM3722109 GSM3722110 GSM3722111 GSM3722112 GSM3722113 GSM3722114 GSM3722115 ,Public on Jul 01 2019,"The mammalian brain is complex, with multiple cell types performing a variety of diverse functions, but exactly how each cell type is affected in aging remains largely unknown.
