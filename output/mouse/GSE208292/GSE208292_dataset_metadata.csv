GSE208292,scRNA-seq of brain cells from 3- and 24-month-old mouse brains,"Microglia are important immune cells in the brain. Microglia undergo a series of alterations during aging and increase the susceptibility to brain dysfunctions. However, the characteristics of microglia during the aging process are not fully understood. In this study, we mapped transcriptional and epigenetic profiles of microglia from 3- to 24-month-old mice. We observed unexpected gender divergences and identified age-dependent microglia (ADEM) genes in the aging process. We then compared characteristics between microglial aging and activation. To dissect the function of aged microglia excluding the influence from other aged brain cells, we established an accelerated microglial turnover model without directly affecting other brain cells. By this model, we achieved aged microglia in non-aged brains and confirmed that aged microglia per se contribute to cognitive decline. Collectively, we provide a comprehensive resource to decode the aging process of microglia, shedding light on how microglia maintain brain functions.
