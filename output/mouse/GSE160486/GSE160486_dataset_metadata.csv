GSE160486,A molecular calcium integrator reveals a striatal cell-type driving aversion,"The ability to record transient cellular events in the DNA or RNA of cells would enable precise, large-scale analysis, selection, and reprogramming of heterogeneous cell populations. Here we report a molecular technology for stable genetic tagging of cells that exhibit activity-related increases in intracellular calcium concentration (FLiCRE). We used FLiCRE to transcriptionally label activated neural ensembles in the nucleus accumbens of the mouse brain during brief stimulation of aversive inputs. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we detected FLiCRE transcripts among the endogenous transcriptome,<c2><a0>providing simultaneous readout of both cell-type and calcium activation history.<c2><a0>We identified a cell-type in the nucleus accumbens activated downstream of long-range excitatory projections. Taking advantage of FLiCRE<e2><80><99>s modular design, we expressed an optogenetic channel selectively in this cell-type, and showed that direct recruitment of this otherwise genetically-inaccessible population elicits behavioral aversion. The specificity and minute-resolution of FLiCRE enables molecularly-informed characterization, manipulation, and reprogramming of activated cellular ensembles.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE160486,33308478,Single-cell RNA sequencing data from the nucleus accumbens of Fli-CRE-labeled Thy1::ChR2 mice,GSM4873966 GSM4873967 GSM4873968 ,Public on Oct 31 2020,"The ability to record transient cellular events in the DNA or RNA of cells would enable precise, large-scale analysis, selection, and reprogramming of heterogeneous cell populations.
