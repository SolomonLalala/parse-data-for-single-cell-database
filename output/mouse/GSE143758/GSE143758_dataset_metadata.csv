GSE143758,Single nuclei RNA-seq of brain of mouse Alzheimer's disease model,"Here we report single nucleus RNA-seq shows in 5xFAD mouse model of AD and WT,  showing changes in the composition and state of multiple cell types. In particular, we identified a unique population of disease-associated astrocytes (DAAs) in AD. DAAs appeared at early disease stages and increased in abundance with age. Similar cells were found in aged WT mice and human brains, suggesting they are linked to both genetic and age-related factors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE143758,32341542,"Single nuclei RNA-seq of WT and 5xFAD mouse brains, from hippocampus brain region",GSM4276891 GSM4276892 GSM4276893 GSM4276894 GSM4276895 GSM4276896 GSM4276897 GSM4276898 GSM4276899 GSM4276900 GSM4276901 GSM4276902 GSM4276903 GSM4276904 GSM4276905 GSM4276906 GSM4276907 GSM4276908 GSM4276909 GSM4276910 GSM4276911 GSM4276912 GSM4276913 GSM4276914 GSM4276915 GSM4276916 GSM4276917 GSM4276918 GSM4276919 GSM4276920 GSM4276921 GSM4276922 GSM4276923 GSM4276924 GSM4276925 GSM4276926 GSM4276927 ,Public on Apr 28 2020,"Here we report single nucleus RNA-seq shows in 5xFAD mouse model of AD and WT,  showing changes in the composition and state of multiple cell types.
