GSE142267,Novel Alzheimer risk genes determine the microglia response to amyloid-<ce><b2> but not to TAU pathology,"Polygenic risk scores have identified that genetic variants without genome-wide significance still add to the genetic risk of developing Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s disease (AD). Whether and how subthreshold risk loci translate into relevant disease pathways, is unknown. We investigate here the involvement of AD risk variants in the transcriptional responses of two mouse models: APPswe/PS1L166P and Thy-TAU22. A unique gene expression module, highly enriched for AD risk genes, is specifically responsive to A<ce><b2> but not TAU pathology. We identify in this module 7 established AD risk genes (APOE, CLU, INPP5D, CD33, PLCG2, SPI1 and FCER1G) and 11 AD GWAS genes below the genome-wide significance threshold (GPC2, TREML2, SYK, GRN, SLC2A5, SAMSN1, PYDC1, HEXB, RRBP1, LYN and BLNK), that become significantly upregulated when exposed to A<ce><b2>. Single microglia sequencing confirms that A<ce><b2>, not TAU, pathology induces marked transcriptional changes in microglia, including increased proportions of activated microglia. We conclude that genetic risk of AD functionally translates into different microglia pathway responses to A<ce><b2> pathology, placing AD genetic risk downstream of the amyloid pathway but upstream of TAU pathology.",https://www.embopress.org/doi/10.15252/emmm.201910606,31951107,"Single cell sequencing on FACS-sorted CD11b+/CD45+ mouse hippocampal microglia, examing APPswe/PSEN1L166P and Thy-TAU22 mice and their respective WT littermates, at 4 and 11 months of age (8 groups in total; 2-3 mice per experimental group).",GSM4224436 GSM4224437 GSM4224438 GSM4224439 GSM4224440 GSM4224441 GSM4224442 GSM4224443 GSM4224444 GSM4224445 ,Public on Jan 14 2020,"Polygenic risk scores have identified that genetic variants without genome-wide significance still add to the genetic risk of developing Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s disease (AD).
