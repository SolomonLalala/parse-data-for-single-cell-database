GSE117295,Spatiotemporal single-cell analysis of gene expression in the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus,"Mammalian circadian behaviors are orchestrated by suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus. Yet basic SCN cell types and their roles in circadian pacemaking are still unclear. In this study, we comprehensively characterized the basic cell types of<c2><a0>SCN and their circadian and light-induced gene expression.<c2><a0>In SCN, we identified seven major cell types among which neurons, astrocytes, ependymocytes and endothelial cells display cell-type specific circadian gene expression. We found that five SCN neuron subtypes, Avp+/Nms+, Vip+/Nms+, Vip+/Grp+, Cck+/C1ql3+ and Cck+/Bdnf+, differ in their spatial distribution, circadian rhythmicity and light responsiveness. Among the rhythmic neuron subtypes, we observed a wave of circadian gene expression propagating from the subtypes in posterior SCN <c2><a0>to the subtypes in anterior SCN. Such wave can be explained by the neuropeptide-receptor signaling network in which Avp+/Nms+ subtype is the leader of circadian oscillations. Our study provides insights into the basic neural mechanism of circadian pacemaking in mammals.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE117295,32066983,Drop-seq of mice SCN at 12 circadian time points and 1 flash stimulate time point,GSM3290582 GSM3290583 GSM3290584 GSM3290585 GSM3290586 GSM3290587 GSM3290588 GSM3290589 GSM3290590 GSM3290591 GSM3290592 GSM3290593 GSM3290594 ,Public on Jun 19 2019,"Mammalian circadian behaviors are orchestrated by suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus.
