GSE173279,Single-cell landscapes of primary glioblastomas and matched organoids and cell lines reveal variable retention of inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity [scWGS],"Glioblastomas (GBMs) are aggressive primary malignant brain tumors characterized by extensive levels of inter- and intra-tumor genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) have recently emerged as useful models to study such heterogeneity. Here, we present bulk exome as well as single-cell genome and transcriptome profiles of primary IDH wild type GBMs from ten patients, including two recurrent tumors, as well as PDOs and brain tumor-initiating cell (BTIC) lines derived from these patients. We find that PDOs are genetically similar to and variably retain gene expression characteristics of their parent tumors. At the phenotypic level, PDOs appear to exhibit similar levels of transcriptional heterogeneity as their parent tumors, whereas BTIC lines tend to be enriched for cells in a more uniform transcriptional state. The datasets introduced here will provide a valuable resource to help guide experiments using GBM-derived organoids, especially in the context of studying cellular heterogeneity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE173279,35303420,"Single-cell whole-genome profiles of primary glioblastoma samples and organoids derived from them
