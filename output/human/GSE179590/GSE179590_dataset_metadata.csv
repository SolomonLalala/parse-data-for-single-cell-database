GSE179590,Single-nucleus RNA sequencing analysis of normal-appearing brains from RRMS and SPMS patients,"snRNA-seq reveals that normal-appearing brain regions from RRMS and SPMS patients have divergent cell type-specific gene expression profiles, with clinical ramifications for approved sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE179590,35783097,"Post-mortem prefrontal cortices (BA10) from donors who suffered from RRMS or SPMS were cryo-sectioned at 300 <c2><b5>m and were processed for nuclei isolation. Single-nucleus capture (target capture of 5,000 nuclei per sample) and library preparation was conducted using Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3' GEM, Library & Gel Bead Kit v3 (10x Genomics) and Chromium Single Cell B Chip Kit (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Single-nucleus libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 machine at GENEWIZ, Inc. Raw FASTQ files were input into the cellranger count pipeline (Cell Ranger V3.0.2, 10x Genomics) to align reads to the GRCh38 human genome.",GSM5420999 GSM5421000 GSM5421001 GSM5421002 GSM5421003 GSM5421004 GSM5421005 GSM5421006 ,Public on Jan 06 2022,"snRNA-seq reveals that normal-appearing brain regions from RRMS and SPMS patients have divergent cell type-specific gene expression profiles, with clinical ramifications for approved sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators.","ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE179nnn/GSE179590/suppl/GSE179590_MS_brains_8samples_cell_lvl_metadata.csv.gz
