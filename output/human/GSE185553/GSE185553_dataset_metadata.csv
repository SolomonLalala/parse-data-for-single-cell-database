GSE185553,Dissecting the transcriptome landscape of the human hippocampus,Here we performed single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis of human hippocampus across the lifespan by split-seq approach,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE185553,35794479,"Single-nucleus RNA-seq was performed using SPLiT-seq. Taking the advantage of the SPLiT-seq platform, we were able to pool multiple samples together for a run to reduce batch effects. Gene expression data of each individual sample could be demultiplexed and sorted out using provided barcodes.",GSM5618237 GSM5618238 GSM5618239 GSM5618240 GSM5618241 ,Public on Apr 19 2022,Here we performed single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis of human hippocampus across the lifespan by split-seq approach,"ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE185nnn/GSE185553/suppl/GSE185553.barcodes.tar.gz
