GSE104276,Single-cell RNA-Seq reveals a developmental atlas of human prefrontal cortex,"Mammalian prefrontal cortex contains billions of cells, some of which are known as neurons to play critical roles in memory, cognitive ability, decision making, social behavior etc. through participating into complex neural circuits. Although neural circuits build up in the late stage of human embryo development and even after birth, the diverse and functional cells start to generate and migrate to the appropriate location play essential roles as basis for developing future circuits. However, it remains challenging to identify cell types of developing human PFC and distinguish their developmental features. Here, to address these challenges, single cells from human embryos PFC were carried out for RNA-seq.  Detailed analysis of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) illustrated a developmental feature of intermediate progenitor (IP) cells and revealed new marker genes of IP cells. We also mapped the neurogenesis timeline of PFC excitatory neurons and intrinsic singles regulating neuron maturation and circuit formation. Our screening and characterization approach provides a blueprint of human PFC development in early and mid embryonic stages, with which to systematically discover the cellular basis and molecular regulation of PFC function in humans.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE104276,29539641,"Here we performed single cell RNA-seq analysis for prefrontal cortex (PFC), covering the developmental stages of gestational weeks 8-26.",GSM2884059 GSM2884060 GSM2884061 GSM2884062 GSM2884063 GSM2884064 GSM2884065 GSM2884066 GSM2884067 GSM2884068 GSM2884069 GSM2884070 GSM2884071 GSM2884072 GSM2884073 GSM2884074 GSM2884075 GSM2884076 GSM2884077 GSM2884078 GSM2884079 GSM2884080 GSM2884081 GSM2884082 GSM2884083 GSM2884084 GSM2884085 GSM2884086 GSM2884087 GSM2884088 GSM2884089 GSM2884090 GSM2884091 GSM2884092 GSM2970391 GSM2970392 GSM2970393 GSM2970394 GSM2970395 ,Public on Feb 10 2018,"Mammalian prefrontal cortex contains billions of cells, some of which are known as neurons to play critical roles in memory, cognitive ability, decision making, social behavior etc. through participating into complex neural circuits.
