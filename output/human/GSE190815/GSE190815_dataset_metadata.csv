GSE190815,Maturation and circuit integration of transplanted human cortical organoids,"We show that human stem cell-derived cortical organoids transplanted into the somatosensory cortex of newborn athymic rats develop mature cell types that integrate into sensory and motivation-related circuits. Magnetic resonance imaging allows monitoring of post-transplantation organoid growth across multiple stem cell lines and animals, while single nucleus profiling reveals high cell diversity and progression of corticogenesis, as well as the emergence of an activity-dependent transcriptional program in neurons.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE190815,36224417,single nucleus RNA-sequencing of transplanted human cortical organoid and age matched cortical organoid,GSM5732392 GSM5732393 GSM5732394 GSM6225773 GSM6225774 GSM6225775 ,Public on Jul 23 2022,"We show that human stem cell-derived cortical organoids transplanted into the somatosensory cortex of newborn athymic rats develop mature cell types that integrate into sensory and motivation-related circuits.
