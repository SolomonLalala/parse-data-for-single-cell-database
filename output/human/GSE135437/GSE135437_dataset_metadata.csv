GSE135437,Mapping microglia diversity in the human brain through the integration of high-dimensional techniques,"Microglia are tissue-resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) that orchestrate local immune responses and contribute to several neurological and psychiatric diseases. Little is known about human microglia and how they orchestrate their highly plastic, context-specific adaptive responses during pathology. Here, we combined two high-dimensional technologies, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and time-of-flight mass cytometry (CyTOF), to identify microglia states in the human brain during homeostasis and disease. This approach enabled us to identify and characterize a previously unappreciated spectrum of transcriptional states in human microglia. These transcriptional states are determined by their spatial distribution, and they further change with aging and brain tumor pathology. The description of multiple microglia phenotypes in the human CNS may open promising new avenues for subset-specific therapeutic interventions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE135437,31740814,"Human surgery samples from controls and Glioblastoma multiforme patients were collected prospectively, FACS sorted on lineage-negative live CD45-positive cells and sequenced using the mCEL-Seq2 protocol.",GSM4008952 GSM4008953 GSM4008954 GSM4008955 GSM4008956 GSM4008957 GSM4008958 GSM4008959 GSM4008960 GSM4008961 GSM4008962 GSM4008963 GSM4008964 GSM4008965 GSM4008966 GSM4008967 GSM4008968 GSM4008969 GSM4008970 GSM4008971 GSM4008972 GSM4008973 GSM4008974 GSM4008975 GSM4008976 GSM4008977 GSM4008978 GSM4008979 GSM4008980 GSM4008981 GSM4008982 GSM4008983 GSM4008984 GSM4008985 GSM4008986 GSM4008987 GSM4008988 GSM4008989 GSM4008990 GSM4008991 GSM4008992 GSM4008993 GSM4008994 GSM4008995 GSM4008996 GSM4008997 GSM4008998 GSM4008999 GSM4009000 GSM4009001 GSM4009002 GSM4009003 GSM4009004 GSM4009005 GSM4009006 GSM4009007 GSM4009008 GSM4009009 GSM4009010 GSM4009011 GSM4009012 GSM4009013 GSM4009014 GSM4009015 GSM4009016 GSM4009017 ,Public on Nov 18 2019,"Microglia are tissue-resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS) that orchestrate local immune responses and contribute to several neurological and psychiatric diseases.
