GSE139448,Characterization of tumor initiating cells from human glioblastoma multiforms by scRNA seq,"Radial Glia (RG) cells are the first neural stem cells to appear during embryonic development. Human embryonic RG cells demonstrates a specific set of gene expression compared to other type of progenitor cells. The goal of this study is to characterize  the potential origine of tumor initiating cells of human glioblastoma multiforms by single cell RNASeq analyses of freshly sorted glioblastoma cells. The objectives are: 1)idetify RG-like cells in adult brain tumor; 2) reveal transcriptionally dynamic clusters of RG-like cells, that share the profiles of normal human fetal radial glia and that reside in quiescent and cycling states; 3) signaling pathways that mediate the transition among the different stages of RG-like cells; 4)genomic aberation analyses to reveal the potential hierarchical tree of RG-like cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE139448,32004492,scRNA seq of freshly sorted cells from specimen of 3 patients,GSM4141788 GSM4141789 GSM4141790 ,Public on Jan 03 2020,"Radial Glia (RG) cells are the first neural stem cells to appear during embryonic development.
