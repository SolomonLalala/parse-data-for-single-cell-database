GSE160936,Diverse human astrocyte and microglial transcriptional responses to Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s pathology,"To better define roles that microglia and astrocytes play in Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s disease (AD), we used single-nuclei RNA-sequencing to comprehensively characterize transcriptomes in these glial nuclei isolated post mortem from non-diseased control and neuropathologically-defined AD brains.  Genes associated with AD risk were highly represented, especially in microglia. Transcriptome differences significantly correlated with immunohistochemical phospho-Tau (pTau) density included genetic risk genes for both microglia (APOE, BIN1, MS4A6A, PILRA) and astrocytes (APOE, CLU, MEF2C, IQCK).  Pathways associated with the top differentially expressed genes in microglia included those related to proteostasis and immune modulation while those for astrocytes also included proteostasis, as well as stress response and metal ion homeostasis.  Inferred regulons generated from co-expression networks implicated distinct transcriptional mechanisms associated with pTau for the two cell types.  Data-driven sub-clustering revealed additional glial cellular heterogeneity.   Our work provides a new resource, highlighting both potential causal mechanisms and protective glial responses in AD.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE160936,34767070,Single-nuclei RNA-sequencing of microglia and astrocyte nuclei isolated post mortem from non-diseased control and neuropathologically-defined AD brains.,GSM4886743 GSM4886744 GSM4886745 GSM4886746 GSM4886747 GSM4886748 GSM4886749 GSM4886750 GSM4886751 GSM4886752 GSM4886753 GSM4886754 GSM4886755 GSM4886756 GSM4886757 GSM4886758 GSM4886759 GSM4886760 GSM4886761 GSM4886762 GSM4886763 GSM4886764 GSM4886765 GSM4886766 ,Public on Oct 01 2021,"To better define roles that microglia and astrocytes play in Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s disease (AD), we used single-nuclei RNA-sequencing to comprehensively characterize transcriptomes in these glial nuclei isolated post mortem from non-diseased control and neuropathologically-defined AD brains.
