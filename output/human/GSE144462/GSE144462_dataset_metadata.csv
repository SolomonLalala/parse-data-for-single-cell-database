GSE144462,Heterogeneity of the human glial progenitor cells,"Glial cells distribute extensively in the brain and execute important functions. However, their developmental process and molecular features are still not fully explored in human, especially for fetal astrocytes. It is known that EGFR is involved in glial development and we found that the emergence of EGFR+ cells are near the start of gliogenesis and majority of those co-expressed SOX2 during human cerebral cortex development at midgestation. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of thousands of EGFR+ cells in the human fetal brain cortex from GW21 to GW26. Compared with other published brain sequencing data, our dataset highly enriched the progenitor cells and glial cells. Multiple molecularly specific populations were identified.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE144462,33657375,"We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on EGFR+ cells isolated from the frontal lobe of the human cerebral cortex from GW21 to GW26 to investigate the molecular features of progenitors, especially for glial cells.
