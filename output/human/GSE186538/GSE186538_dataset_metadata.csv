GSE186538,"Transcriptomic Taxonomy and Neurogenic Trajectories of Adult Human, Macaque and Pig Hippocampal and Entorhinal Cells","The hippocampal-entorhinal system supports cognitive functions, has lifelong neurogenic capabilities in many species, and is selectively vulnerable to Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s disease. To investigate neurogenic potential and cellular diversity, we profiled single-nucleus transcriptomes in five hippocampal-entorhinal subregions in human, macaque, and pig.  Integrated cross-species analysis revealed robust transcriptomic and histologic signatures of neurogenesis in adult mouse, pig and macaque, but not humans. Doublecortin (DCX), a widely accepted marker of newly generated granule cells, was detected in diverse human neurons, but it did not define immature neuron populations. To explore species differences in cellular diversity and implications for disease, we characterized subregion-specific transcriptomically-defined cell types and transitional changes from the three-layered archicortex to the six-layered neocortex. Notably, METTL7B defined subregion-specific excitatory neurons and astrocytes in primates, associated with endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplet proteins, including Alzheimer's disease-related proteins. Together this resource reveals cell-type- and species-specific properties shaping hippocampal-entorhinal neurogenesis and function.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE186538,34798047,"snRNA-seq of hippocampal-entorhinal system in 6 human donors, dentate gyrus in 3 rhesus macaque donors, and adult hippocampus in 9 pig donors with different postmortem intervals (30 minutes, 1 hour, 7 hour)",GSM5655402 GSM5655403 GSM5655404 GSM5655405 GSM5655406 GSM5655407 GSM5655408 GSM5655409 GSM5655410 GSM5655411 GSM5655412 GSM5655413 GSM5655414 GSM5687879 GSM5687880 GSM5687881 GSM5687882 GSM5687883 GSM5687884 GSM5687885 GSM5687886 GSM5687887 GSM5687888 GSM5687889 GSM5687890 GSM5687891 GSM5687892 GSM5687893 GSM5687894 GSM5687895 GSM5687896 GSM5687897 GSM5687898 GSM5687899 GSM5687900 GSM5687901 GSM5687902 GSM5687903 GSM5687904 GSM5687905 GSM5687906 GSM5687907 GSM5687908 GSM5687909 GSM5687910 GSM5687911 GSM5687912 GSM5687913 GSM5687914 GSM5687915 ,Public on Nov 18 2021,"The hippocampal-entorhinal system supports cognitive functions, has lifelong neurogenic capabilities in many species, and is selectively vulnerable to Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s disease.
