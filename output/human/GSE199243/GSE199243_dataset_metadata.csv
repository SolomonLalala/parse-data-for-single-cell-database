GSE199243,A Single-Cell Transcriptome Atlas of Glia Diversity in the Human Hippocampus across the Lifespan and in Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s Disease,"Hippocampus is a critical region involved in learning, memory and various brain disorders. The molecular diversity of various glial cells in the human hippocampus and their temporal changes over the postnatal life remain largely unknown. Here we performed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to create a transcriptome atlas of the human hippocampus across the postnatal lifespan and in Alzheimer<e2><80><99>s disease (AD). Detailed analyses of astrocytes, oligodendrocyte lineages, and microglia identified subpopulations with distinct transcriptomic signatures, transcription factor expression patterns, association with specific biological processes, and changes in their abundance with age. Enrichment analysis of brain disorder risk gene expression further implicates specific glial cells and subpopulations in various brain disorders. Furthermore, we identified dysregulated gene expression in specific glial subpopulations in the hippocampus of AD patients. Together, these data provide a rich resource and significantly extend our understanding of human glial cell diversity and their temporal distribution across the postnatal lifespan.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE199243,36332572,single nucleus RNA-seq on human hippocampus,GSM5967896 GSM5967897 GSM5967898 GSM5967899 GSM5967900 GSM5967901 GSM5967902 GSM5967903 GSM5967904 GSM5967905 GSM5967906 GSM5967907 GSM5967908 ,Public on Aug 26 2022,"Hippocampus is a critical region involved in learning, memory and various brain disorders.
